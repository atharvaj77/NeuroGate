# NeuroGate Branding Guidelines

> **Status**: Research Project
> **License**: MIT
> **Positioning**: "The Agent-Native AI Kernel"

## Core Philosophy
NeuroGate is an **experimental research project**, not a commercial product. All communication should reflect this distinction to ensure clarity and avoid legal ambiguity.

### Approved Terminology
- ✅ **"AI Kernel"**: Use this to describe the core middleware.
- ✅ **"Research Project"**: Use this to describe the overall initiative.
- ✅ **"Community" / "Contributors"**: Use these terms for users.
- ✅ **"Experimental"**: Use this for beta features.

### Forbidden Terminology
- ❌ **"Operating System"**: Too broad and legally loaded.
- ❌ **"Product" / "Platform"**: Implies commercial intent.
- ❌ **"Customers" / "Clients"**: We have contributors and users, not customers.
- ❌ **"Enterprise Edition"**: Implies a paid tier. Use "Enterprise Core" (tech stack) instead.

## Visual Identity
- **Theme**: "Deep Space" (Violet/Cyan/Dark).
- **Vibe**: Futuristic, Technical, Academic, Transparent.
- **Iconography**: Use `react-icons` (FaGithub, FaBrain) to emphasize open-source roots.

## Content Rules
1.  **No Sales Copy**: Focus on technical benefits (latency, accuracy), not business benefits (revenue, ROI).
2.  **Transparency First**: Always link to the source code.
3.  **Academic Rigor**: Cite algorithms (e.g., "Consensus Voting", "Reversible Tokenization") rather than marketing buzzwords.
